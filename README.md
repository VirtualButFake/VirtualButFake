# Hey, I'm Virtual!

I'm a Dutch developer who does a little bit of everything. I'm a full stack developer with a passion for UI, proficient primarily in Luau.
I primarily work on ROBLOX but I'm always trying to expand my range of skills, trying new things.

# Skills
* Languages
    * Luau
    * JavaScript (incl. Node)
    * TypeScript
    * C#
    * C++
* Game development: 7 years of ROBLOX game development experience
* UI & UX design: 5 years of experience, including usage of frameworks like Roact or Fusion.
* Security: Security is one of my largest passions - I enjoy looking for vulnerabilities in my own code and creating systems designed at patching these vulnerabilities, primarily in games. 
* External tooling: Extensive experience with tools such as Rojo and Git to create efficient workflows for both large and small studios.
