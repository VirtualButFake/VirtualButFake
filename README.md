Hey!

I'm Virtual, a 17 year old self taught programmer & UI Designer.
I started my programming adventure when I was just 7 - using simple languages such as Scratch. I then moved on to more complicated languages as time went on & eventually found ROBLOX. I've contributed to several large scale projects and enjoy ROBLOX to this day. 

If you ever want to ask me something or want to commission me, don't hesitate to contact me at Virtual#0021 on Discord.
